# Python GUI Project: Email and Password validator

## Overview

Graphical User Interface also known as GUI(pronounced as gee-uu-eye) is a visual representation of interactive components of a computer program. 
GUI enables non-programmers to easily interact with computer programs with the use of interactive visual components such as buttons, toolbars, menus, textboxes, etc.

This GUI project aims at creating an easy to use graphical user interface to validate both email and password text inputs. 
The GUI consists of:
  * Textboxes for users to input email and password.
  * Button to execute email and password validation operation.
  * Labels to provide description on the information to input into the provided textboxes.
  * Messagebox to display result response of validation.
